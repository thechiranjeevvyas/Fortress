# 🛡️ Fortress – Antivirus Based on Machine Learning 

> ⚙️ *"Smart. Adaptive. Secure. A next-gen AI-powered antivirus."*

---

## 🧠 Project Overview 

**Fortress** is a modern antivirus system built using **machine learning** to detect, prevent, and mitigate malware threats in real time. Unlike traditional signature-based antivirus solutions, **Fortress** adapts to evolving threats using **heuristic analysis** and **hash-based detection** — all wrapped in a clean **Django GUI interface**. 

---

## ✨ Features 

- 🤖 **ML-Powered Threat Detection** Detects both known and zero-day threats using trained machine learning models. 

- 🧩 **Hashing Techniques** Compares file hashes (e.g., SHA-256) against known malware signature databases. 

- 🔍 **Heuristic Analysis** Flags suspicious behavior patterns and identifies unknown malicious files. 

- 🖥️ **User-Friendly Django GUI** A simple, responsive interface to interact with the antivirus system. 

- 🔐 **Real-Time Protection** Constantly monitors file activity to prevent execution of dangerous files.
