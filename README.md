By employing machine learning, Kavach AI offers proactive threat detection that adapts to new and evolving threats, making it more effective than traditional antivirus solutions.

## Features

- **Machine Learning-based Detection**: Uses ML models to identify both known and unknown malware.
- **Hashing Techniques**: Compares file hashes against a database of known malware signatures for quick identification.
- **Heuristic Analysis**: Detects suspicious behavior patterns to identify previously unseen threats.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Built using Django to provide an easy-to-navigate GUI.
- **Real-time Protection**: Monitors system activity and prevents malicious files from executing.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.8+
- **Framework:** Django 3.2+ (for GUI and backend)
- **Machine Learning Libraries:**
- **Scikit-learn** 0.24+
- **TensorFlow** 2.5+
- **Pandas** 1.3+
- **NumPy **1.21+
- **Hash Technique:** SHA-256 hashing to identify known malicious files.
- **Heuristic Approach:** Detects abnormal system behavior or file attributes to identify potential new threats.
